                .Net Core

-- This is a complete re-written version of .Net Framework 
	.Net Framework was available only for windows platform 
	.Net framework did not follow open source design pattern
	.Was not purely an open source
	.Needed Visual Studio (this is a licenced version, availble for windows and mac)
		Visual Studio needed windows OS (pay the licence)
		Can host only on IIS, which was available on Windows Server(again a cost)
		Not compatible with Clouds other than microsoft
	.Open source free to develop and host applications this days
		Angular, Node, React, MERN stack 
		--Thus microsoft had to rewrite the framework

			which is 
			1. Open source
			2. Availabel for All platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android etc...)
			3. Free to develop and host
			4. We have Visual Studio Code, excellent tool for all platforms
			5. Follows all the open source Design patterns
