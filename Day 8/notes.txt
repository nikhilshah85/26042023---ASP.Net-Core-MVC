1. We want to have a secured application 
	we do not want users to view content (pages) if they are not logged-in

	how to allow users to log-in 
		a. create a new account
		b. use any existing account (Facebook, google, twitter, linked etc, o365)
			oAuth (open source authentication)
			we will implement it here with MVC


Today 
This is a super new and imporant feature of .net core - super userful
2. DataAnnotation - used for Dataformat, data validation for client side and server - centreally



1. Create a new database - employeeManagement
	we need 2 tables with sample data
	
		1. deptInfo
			deptNo int primary key
			deptName varchar(20) - unique key
			deptCity

		add 5 sample dept

		2. empInfo
			empNo int primary key
			empName varchar(20) - check constraint - min 3 characters needed
			empDesignation(20) - allow only - Developer, Manager, HR
			empSalary int (only between 12000 and 50000)
			empDept - foreign key with 1st table
			empIsPermenant - bit (bool)

		add 8 sample emp


2. Create a new MVC application - employeeManagement_MVC

3. Add all 4 nuget packages

4. Generate POCO classes

5. Generate controllers and views based on EF, build and test the application 

6. As the data lables are not as per presentaion practices, we cannot use the same for presentation

	also the constraints are there

	Option 1: we write Validation code by ourself in front end, both Javascript and C#
	option 2: use System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations - in Model File
